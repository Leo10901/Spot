<h2>☀️ June & July at SpotTO: New Scholarships, Wild Resumes & Why It’s Never Too Late to Start</h2>

<b>Hey Spotters 👋,</b>
<p>
We’re rolling into summer with a burst of opportunity — and whether you’ve been grinding since January or just realized it’s time to make your summer count, SpotTO has your back.

📝 This is our very first monthly blog post — and we’re just getting started. Expect fresh updates every month with new opportunities, cool features, and student highlights. Keep your eye on this space 👀.
🎓 New Scholarships Just Dropped

We’re excited to announce new scholarships for June and July, available to high school and post-secondary students across the GTA. Whether you're aiming to fund your first year at university or cover the cost of prep courses, books, or even transit, these opportunities are here to make summer dreams more accessible.

👉 How to apply?
Just head to https://spot-to.com, explore what’s available, and apply to the ones that match your goals. Applications are straightforward — we prioritize effort and intention over perfection.

💼 Internships & Jobs: It’s Not Too Late

Still haven’t locked down that summer gig? You’re not behind — you’re right on time. Businesses, startups, and nonprofits across Toronto are still actively looking for students who want to gain real-world experience, even for just a few weeks.

Still skeptical?
Check out these legends:

📦 The Donut Box Resume: One job seeker delivered their resume inside a Krispy Kreme box. Not only did it get read — they got hired.
🖥️ The Hacker Resume: A bold applicant rewrote a company’s homepage to display their resume. Wild move (and 100% illegal — we do NOT condone it), but undeniably creative. They got the interview.
🛵 The TikTok Delivery: One student filmed themselves delivering a resume like a pizza — on a scooter. The employer loved the creativity. Instant callback.
Bottom line? People hire effort. People remember creativity.

💡 Late Start? No Problem.

If you're just getting started, here’s what we recommend:

Look for micro-internships: Some opportunities last only 1–2 weeks — still great for learning and your resume.
Cold emails work: Tons of opportunities aren’t posted online. Reach out with confidence.
Personality = Power: Whether it’s a fun one-liner or a bold format, make your resume yours.
🔎 Coming Soon: SpotTO’s Opportunity Tracker

We’re currently building a smart web scraper to constantly find local scholarships, internships, and programs — and match them to your availability and interests.

You won’t have to search endlessly anymore — we’re making sure the opportunities come to you.
Stay tuned — we’ll be releasing updates as the feature goes live this summer. 👨‍💻
