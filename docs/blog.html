        <h2> August at Spot-TO: Tips and Tricks for Nailing a Resume </h2>
        <b>Hello Spotters, </b>
        <p>We hope your summer is going great! In this exclusive monthly post, we’re going to dive into the essential steps for crafting a standout resume that will truly make you shine.</p>

        <b>1. Organization</b>
        <p>Proper organization is a reflection of your attention to detail and quality of work, so it’s crucial to structure your resume thoughtfully.</p>
        
        <b>2. The Ideal Resume Format:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Name, Contact Info, Address</li>
            <li>Objective</li>
            <li>Education</li>
            <li>Experience</li>
            <li>Skills, Qualities, Hobbies</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Let’s break down these components and I’ll give you specific recommendations for each:</p>

        <h3>Name, Contact Info, Address</h3>
        <p>This section is pretty straightforward—make sure your name, contact details, and address are clearly presented at the top of your resume. Stick to a professional email address—avoid using personal or playful ones.</p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>    
        <p>The objective is a crucial part, where you’ll connect your interests and experiences to the specific job you’re applying for. Limit it to 1-2 sentences, and align it with the job description. If needed, use tools like ChatGPT to help structure your objective, but always make sure it reflects your unique qualifications.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>List your educational background in chronological order, highlighting any relevant achievements. Don't hesitate to mention awards, honors, or other educational experiences like specialized camps or certifications.</p>     

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>This is the meat of your resume, so it’s essential to organize it effectively. Under each experience, list 3-5 bullet points that describe your role and contributions. Be Specific! talk about a how much you raised, how much members to a club you brought in or what you discovered. For more advanced resumes, you can add more details, but ensure that each point is relevant to the job you’re applying for. Remember to be consistent with punctuation, especially whether you use periods after each point.</p>
        
        <p>Start each experience with an action verb or adjective that reflects your role. You can use tools like ChatGPT to tailor your wording, but I encourage you to develop your own writing skills over time for a more authentic touch.</p>

        <h3>Skills, Qualities, Hobbies</h3>
        <p>These are optional but can help differentiate you. Instead of listing generic traits like "confidence" or "organization," specify your skills. For example, if you’re applying for a digital marketing job and are proficient with Canva or Figma, mention “Technical Proficiency” or “Graphic Design” to align your resume with the role you're targeting.</p>

        <h3>Final Tips:</h3>
        <p>I can’t stress this enough: organization matters! Hiring managers often spend just a few seconds reviewing each resume, so clarity and structure are immediately apparent. If your resume is on the shorter side (for those with less experience), try to keep it to one page. Make sure your dates are aligned and formatted consistently—use three-letter abbreviations (e.g., Jan, Feb, Mar) and italicize them, followed by the year or year span.</p>

        <p>For the layout, ensure all section headings are in uppercase, and make your experience entries bold so they stand out. You can also adjust spacing in tools like Google Docs to ensure everything looks neat and aligned.</p>

<h2>☀️ June & July at SpotTO: New Scholarships, Wild Resumes & Why It’s Never Too Late to Start</h2>

<b>Hey Spotters 👋,</b>
<p>We’re rolling into summer with a burst of opportunity — and whether you’ve been grinding since January or just realized it’s time to make your summer count, SpotTO has your back.</p>

<b>📝 This is our very first monthly blog post — and we’re just getting started. Expect fresh updates every month with new opportunities, cool features, and student highlights. Keep your eye on this space 👀.</b>
<h2>🎓 New Scholarships Just Dropped</h2>

<p>We’re excited to announce new scholarships for June and July, available to high school and post-secondary students across the GTA. Whether you're aiming to fund your first year at university or cover the cost of prep courses, books, or even transit, these opportunities are here to make summer dreams more accessible.</p>

<h2>👉 How to apply?</h2>
<p>Just head to https://spot-to.com, explore what’s available, and apply to the ones that match your goals. Applications are straightforward — we prioritize effort and intention over perfection.</p>

<h2>💼 Internships & Jobs: It’s Not Too Late</h2>

<b>Still haven’t locked down that summer gig? You’re not behind — you’re right on time. Businesses, startups, and nonprofits across Toronto are still actively looking for students who want to gain real-world experience, even for just a few weeks.</b>

<h2>Still skeptical?</h2>
<b>Check out these legends:</b

<ul><b>📦 The Donut Box Resume:</b></ul><p> One job seeker delivered their resume inside a Krispy Kreme box. Not only did it get read — they got hired.</p>
<ul><b>🖥️ The Hacker Resume:</b></ul><p> A bold applicant rewrote a company’s homepage to display their resume. Wild move (and 100% illegal — we do NOT condone it), but undeniably creative. They got the interview.</p>
<ul><b>🛵 The TikTok Delivery:</b></ul> <p>One student filmed themselves delivering a resume like a pizza — on a scooter. The employer loved the creativity. Instant callback.
Bottom line? People hire effort. People remember creativity.</p>

<h2>💡 Late Start? No Problem.</h2>

<b>If you're just getting started, here’s what we recommend:</b>

<p>Look for micro-internships: Some opportunities last only 1–2 weeks — still great for learning and your resume.
Cold emails work: Tons of opportunities aren’t posted online. Reach out with confidence.
Personality = Power: Whether it’s a fun one-liner or a bold format, make your resume yours.</p>
